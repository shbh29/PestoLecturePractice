any object that has Symbol.interator implemented will be traversed by for of loop. for of loop
can traverse through iterables. Iterables example are array, map, dom elements, sets.

returning object from symbol.iterator method should have a next method implemented.
next method should return an object with specific keys { value: 'value', done: false/true};
